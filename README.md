# Premier League 2023–24 Player Performance Analysis
**Overview**
This project presents a comprehensive data exploration and visualization of the Premier League 2023–24 season, focusing on player performance across multiple key metrics. The analysis uses various plots and visual representations to highlight patterns, trends, and standout performances among players in the league. By examining scoring ability, creativity, efficiency, positional workload, and progression metrics, the project aims to provide a holistic view of how players contributed to their teams throughout the season. The dataset for this project is taken from kaggle.

The dataset includes detailed player statistics from the 2023–24 season, which were processed and visualized to extract actionable insights. The findings are displayed through intuitive and engaging visualizations that make it easier to interpret complex statistical information.

****Key Visualizations & Insights****

**1. Top 10 Goal Scorers**
This plot showcases the players who scored the most goals during the season. It allows for quick identification of the most prolific forwards and attacking midfielders, showing their dominance in front of goal. This visualization also provides context for comparing efficiency between high-scoring players.

**2. Top 10 Assist Providers**
Creativity is just as important as finishing. This chart highlights the top 10 players with the most assists in the season, demonstrating their role in chance creation and team buildup. These players are often central playmakers or wingers who excel in delivering decisive passes.

**3. Players with the Most Expected Goals (xG)**
Expected Goals (xG) is a key advanced metric that evaluates the quality of scoring opportunities rather than just counting goals. This plot ranks the players with the highest cumulative xG over the season, indicating who consistently found themselves in good scoring positions. Comparing xG to actual goals scored can also reveal clinical finishers or underperformers.

**4. Goals Scored by Different Age Categories**
Age plays a significant role in player performance and career trajectory. This visualization categorizes players by age groups (e.g., under 21, 21–25, 26–30, 31+) and compares their total goals scored. This helps identify the peak scoring age range and shows whether younger or older players contributed more in the season.

**5. Minutes Played by Different Position Players**
Different positions have different playing time patterns due to tactical roles, substitutions, and rotation. This plot shows the distribution of minutes played by players in various positions (e.g., forwards, midfielders, defenders, goalkeepers). It offers insights into positional workload and team reliance on certain roles.

**6. Progressive Passes, Carries, and Runs**
Progression is crucial in moving the ball effectively toward goal. This visualization examines progressive passes, carries, and runs to determine which players advanced the ball most effectively. These metrics reveal not just goal scorers or assist providers, but also the key players who helped transition play from defense to attack.

**Purpose of the Project**
The main objective of this project is to combine statistical analysis with visual storytelling to provide a clear, insightful, and accessible overview of the Premier League 2023–24 season. By using data visualization techniques, we can better understand how different players impacted the game, whether through scoring, creating, defending, or progressing play.

The project also serves as a tool for analysts, coaches, and fans to explore trends that are not immediately visible through raw statistics alone. For example:

Did players with high xG underperform or overperform in goals scored?

Which age category contributed most to the league’s goals?

Which positions logged the most minutes on the pitch?

Who were the key players in ball progression?

**Tools & Methods**
The analysis and visualizations were carried out using Python with data analysis and visualization libraries such as:

Pandas – for data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for static data visualization


The dataset was cleaned, processed, and transformed before creating the visualizations. All charts were designed to be clear, informative, and aesthetically consistent, ensuring ease of interpretation.

**Conclusion**
This project provides an in-depth visual and statistical analysis of player performances in the 2023–24 Premier League season. By combining traditional statistics like goals and assists with advanced metrics such as xG and progressive actions, it delivers a balanced and multi-dimensional perspective on the game.

The visualizations not only celebrate the standout performers of the season but also reveal hidden insights about player efficiency, creativity, and tactical roles. Whether for football enthusiasts, analysts, or data visualization learners, this project demonstrates how statistical exploration can bring the season’s story to life.
